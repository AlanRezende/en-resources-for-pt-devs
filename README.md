# English resources for [pt] devs
I'll save here some helpful resources that have aided me in advancing my English path.

## Google Translator
You can use the good old translator anywhere, anytime on your computer or phone.

It can be accessed through [Website](https://translate.google.com.br/?hl=pt-BR&sl=en&tl=pt) or installed on iOS and Android.

## [English Experts](https://www.englishexperts.com.br/)

A website with an infinite amount of resources focused on Portuguese speakers.

One of the sections that I find very useful is their [Forum](https://www.englishexperts.com.br/forum/) on which you can find answers to “how to say that in English” because sometimes we want to sound more natural and not get a word-by-word translation.

Some features are paid, but you can get a lot of value for free by registering an account.

## More to come…
I’ll update this list every day, so keep tuned.
